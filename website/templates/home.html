              <h2 class = "aboutUs">About Us</h2>
              <p>Friends of Children with Special Needs at UC Davis works closely with local non-profit organization Friends of Children With Special Needs to provide students with volunteer and leadership opportunities. Our club is dedicated to channeling hope, support and awareness towards the special needs community. We work closely with FCSN to bridge the gap between the neurotypical and the special needs community. We also organize fundraisers for children with special needs in different parts of the world to support them in their education. Above all, we strive to reduce the stigma surrounding the special needs community and to encourage strong, loving bonds between the special needs community and the society as a whole.</p>
